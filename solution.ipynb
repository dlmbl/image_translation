    "In this exercise, we will solve an image translation task to predict fluorescence images of nuclei and membrane markers from quantitative phase images of cells. In other words, we will _virtually stain_ the nuclei and membrane visible in the phase image. \n",

    "Here, the source domain is label-free microscopy (material density) and the target domain is fluorescence microscopy (fluorophore density). The goal is to learn a mapping from the source domain to the target domain. We will use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically, a U-Net model with residual connections to learn the mapping. The preprocessing, training, prediction, evaluation, and deployment steps are unified in a computer vision pipeline for single-cell analysis that we call [VisCy](https://github.com/mehta-lab/VisCy).\n",

We will use a dataset of 301 fields of view (FOVs) of Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells, each FOV has 3 channels (phase, membrane, and nuclei). The cells were labeled with CRISPR editing.
